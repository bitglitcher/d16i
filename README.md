# D16i
Verilog D16i Core 

The D16i is a simple 16bit arquitecture. Some of the files in the project are not used
like the timer or the uart module, those are separate things that can be added when 
imptementing a system.

This core by it self takes about 1000 LUTs on a Cyclone IV fpga.

This is a personal project and not guarantee by any means. The final goal of this
architecture is to be able to run GCC generated code. Im working on an assembler and
in a small SoC which should be able to synthesize on any small fpga
without external hardware.

# Want to join the project?

Anyone who wants to help porting this architecture to GCC is welcome to join.

I do this for a hobby so don't expect perfect engieenering. But I will try my best to make things work.
